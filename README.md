# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
 
Data Source: [city_data.csv](http://localhost:8888/edit/Desktop/Bootcamp/Bootcamp%20Homework/Week_5_PyBer_Analysis/Resources/city_data.csv), [ride_data.csv](http://localhost:8888/edit/Desktop/Bootcamp/Bootcamp%20Homework/Week_5_PyBer_Analysis/Resources/ride_data.csv)

Software: Python3, Jupyter Notebook

### Results: 
![Summary of driver data](https://github.com/matthallman/Week_5_PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Summary_data.png)
- Rural areas have the least amount of rides, total drivers, and revenue, but have the highest average fare per ride and average per driver.
- Urban areas have the highest ride demand and drivers as well as revenue, but have the lowest average fare per ride and average per driver.

### Summary: 
Based on the results, provide recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
- Look into adding or recruiting more rural drivers to meet the demand.
- Consider increasing the fee per ride or adjust to a pay per mile pricing structure in urban areas.
