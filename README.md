The data may be used to consider the following:

Such a vast difference in avg fare per driver may pull drivers out to the suburbs/rural areas. Consider researching pay per mile and tweaking the pay structure if the pay per mile is significantly higher in less urban areas

Consider increasing the fare in urban areas for more profit since almost 2/3 of rides are in urban areas

Consider incentives to hire more suburban/rural drivers since the avg fare is so high. Whether this is to high demand or longer rides or some other factor should be investigated. If rides are more profitable then getting more rural/suburban business should be a top priority
